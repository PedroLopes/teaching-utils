===What is this?

This is source code (C code) for a very simple, yet powerful, grew generator. 


===How did you make it?

This is a derived code from the project below. It seems to have been lost in the mist of the interwebz, so I guess this tiny project also aims at keeping it alive. 

Which meansâ€¦ license remains as bellow (original README below).

End.

=============================================================================

gear,

This program generates an open office drawing of a gear.
I use it to draw gears in a size that i can jigsaw out of wood,
but it is easily 'tweakable' to make any kind of gear you would like. .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licencse : 

  This program is brought to you without any guarantee on its functioning,
  no guarantee on anything.
  
  but (on the positive side) this program must come with source, you can and may
  modify anything. as long as the message 'derived from gear made by Dries Pruimboom'
  is in your files...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does it work?

I unzipped an open office drawing and looked how the lines in a file were
made, then i automatically generated the lines into the content.xml file
and zip the stuff again to make a valid document.

Isn't it great to have open formats (that are also well readable. . .)!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is essential. . .

Well, in the archive that you got this program in, there is a 'odg' directory
this contains all the files that make up a valid OpenOffice drawing. The program
should be run in a place where this odg directory is found. . .

example   you unzipped this archive in a temp directory and now your file tree looks
          like this :  temp/gear/odg
          then you should run the gear program from the temp/gear directory. . 
          
          well, it isn't that hard, you will figure it out. . .

Good luck
