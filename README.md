teaching-utils
=============

This is a collection of scripts I use to automate teaching tasks. It includes the following:

## grade email sender (takes a csv with grades, comments and emails that to students)

1. ``sendgrades.py```: this (python) script takes a takes a csv with grades, comments and emails that to students using google email API (requires you to setup your API credentials). This is my favorite script and I use it 100x a year.

## automatic unziping (e.g., from Google Forms/Drive submissions)

2. ``unzip-all-homeworks.sh``: this (bash) script extracts any .zip files found in the current directory and deletes them after.
3. ``unzip-homeworks-into-named-folders.sh``: this (bash) script extracts any .zip files found in the current directoryinto individual directories, each sharing the name of the original zip.

## filename renaming (e.g., rename files to a specific convention)

4. ``filenameConvention.sh``: this (bash + python) script renames picture filenames (as generated by android phone or OSX screenshorts) to a adifferent format and suffixes a string, for simplicity or archiving. 

## exam placement sheet generator

5. ``generateStudentsSheets.py``: this (python) script generates PDFs that you can print for student placement in exams.

## mechanical gear generator (for vector editing, laser cutting, etc)

6. ``gear.c``: this (C) script provides a simple gear generator (derived code, see details in code).
